# Developers Guide

## Technical Overview
This repository uses decision records to track architectural and coding-style choices. Each decision is stored as a standalone markdown file under the `decisions` directory.

## Before start
1. Read `README.md` to understand the product and goals.
2. Review existing decision records in `decisions` directory to understand current architecture and coding conventions.

## Decision Records
All significant decisions should be written up as decision records. 
Each decision is stored as a standalone markdown file under the `decisions` directory. 
Before making changes, read the latest records to avoid conflicts and ensure alignment.
File naming follows the format: `decision_{yyyyMMddHHmmss}.md`.
Decision records are for structure, architecture, and long-term best practices. Do not create decision records for version-only dependency updates.
