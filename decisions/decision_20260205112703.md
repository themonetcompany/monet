- Topic: Prefer monads across the codebase

## Decision
We will use monads as much as possible across the codebase to model computations, effects, and error handling.

## Rationale
A consistent monadic style improves composability, predictability, and explicit handling of side effects and failures.

## Consequences
- New code should favor monadic abstractions for effectful or fallible logic.
- Existing code should be refactored toward monads when touched, unless it would reduce clarity.
