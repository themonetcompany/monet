- Topic: Anti-forgery policy for file import API endpoint

## Decision
The endpoint `POST /api/transactions/import` explicitly disables anti-forgery validation.

## Rationale
This endpoint is a backend API route consumed via Swagger and API clients rather than browser form posts with anti-forgery tokens.

## Consequences
- The import route no longer requires antiforgery middleware or tokens.
- The rest of the application remains unaffected by this endpoint-level policy.
