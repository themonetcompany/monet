# Decision Record

- Date: 07-02-2026 12:15:28
- Topic: Swagger availability by environment

## Decision
Swagger (OpenAPI + Swagger UI) is enabled only in the development environment for the Web API.

## Rationale
This gives fast API discoverability during development while avoiding documentation UI exposure in non-development environments.

## Consequences
- Developers can access interactive API documentation at `/swagger` in development.
- Swagger middleware is not active in non-development environments.
