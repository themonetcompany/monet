- Topic: Transaction-category compatibility by flow type

## Decision
Category assignment enforces strict compatibility between transaction flow type and category flow type: Expense transactions accept only Expense categories, Income transactions accept only Income categories, and Neutral transactions cannot be categorized.

## Rationale
Flow-constrained assignment prevents semantic inconsistencies and keeps reporting dimensions coherent.

## Consequences
- Category assignment validates business rules server-side.
- Invalid combinations return explicit application errors.
- Neutral transactions remain uncategorized by design.
