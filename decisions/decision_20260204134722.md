# Decision Record

- Date: 04-02-2026 13:47:22
- Topic: Project naming conventions

## Decision
- All projects must use the `{SolutionName}` prefix.
- Presentation-layer projects must be named `{SolutionName}.{ProjectName}` (e.g., `Monet.WebApp`).
- Infrastructure-layer projects must be named `{SolutionName}.Infrastructure.{ProjectName}` (e.g., `Monet.Infrastructure.MySql`).
- Test projects must use the same name as the project they test, with the suffix `.Tests`.

## Rationale
Keeps project identities consistent and makes layer ownership explicit.

## Consequences
All future projects in these layers must follow these naming patterns.
