- Topic: Backend architecture pattern (CQRS)

## Decision
The backend will follow the CQRS pattern, separating command handling from query handling in the application layer.

## Rationale
CQRS aligns with the existing Clean Architecture and Event Sourcing choices, clarifies responsibilities, and enables independent scaling of reads and writes.

## Consequences
Application use cases must be implemented as commands or queries with dedicated handlers, and API endpoints should delegate to the appropriate side.
