# Decision Record

- Date: 04-02-2026 13:41:32
- Topic: Architecture and source layout

## Decision
Use Clean Architecture. Under `src`, create these top-level directories:
- `Presenters` for the presentation layer
- `Application` for the application and domain layers
- `Infrastructures` for the infrastructure layer

## Rationale
Separates concerns clearly and aligns with Clean Architecture conventions.

## Consequences
Projects and code must be placed under the appropriate layer directory.
