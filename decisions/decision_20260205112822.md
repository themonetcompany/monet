- Topic: Async naming convention for C# methods

## Decision
All C# methods that return a `Task` must include the `Async` suffix in their name.

## Rationale
This aligns with .NET conventions and makes asynchronous behavior explicit at call sites.

## Consequences
- New async methods must use the `Async` suffix.
- Existing async methods should be renamed when touched, updating call sites accordingly.
