- Topic: Transaction category catalog modeled with Event Sourcing

## Decision
Transaction categories are modeled as event-sourced domain entities using the `CategoryCreated` event and projected as a global read model.

## Rationale
This keeps category lifecycle aligned with the existing Event Sourcing architecture and prepares future user-driven category creation without redesigning storage or projections.

## Consequences
- Category state is reconstructed from events.
- The current hardcoded catalog is only a bootstrap source, not the long-term data model.
- Future category CRUD can reuse the same event stream and projection.
