- Topic: Date and time usage

## Decision
Use `DateTimeOffset` instead of `DateTime` whenever working with date and time values.

## Rationale
`DateTimeOffset` preserves the offset information, avoiding ambiguity across time zones and making temporal data safer to store and exchange.

## Consequences
New code should prefer `DateTimeOffset` for timestamps, time-based fields, and API contracts. Existing `DateTime` usage should be migrated when touched.
