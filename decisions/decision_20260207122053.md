# Decision Record

- Topic: Swagger access through Angular development host

## Decision
In development, Angular dev server must proxy `/swagger` requests to the backend API host (`http://127.0.0.1:5050`).

## Rationale
This provides a single local entry point on `http://localhost:4200` for both frontend and API documentation.

## Consequences
- `http://localhost:4200/swagger` resolves to backend Swagger UI in development.
- Proxy configuration now includes both `/api` and `/swagger`.
