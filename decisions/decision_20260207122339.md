- Topic: File upload binding style for import endpoint

## Decision
The transaction import endpoint binds uploaded content directly through an `IFormFile` parameter rather than reading form data manually from `HttpRequest`.

## Rationale
Typed binding improves OpenAPI generation and enables Swagger UI to render the file picker automatically for multipart uploads.

## Consequences
- Swagger exposes a file upload field for the import route.
- Endpoint logic keeps only file validation/parsing/application-command orchestration.
