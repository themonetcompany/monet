- Topic: Extensible transaction import parser strategy in Web API

## Decision
The API import route will delegate file parsing to a strategy interface (`ITransactionImportFileParser`) selected by a resolver (`ITransactionImportFileParserSelector`) based on the uploaded file metadata.

## Rationale
This keeps the route/application boundary stable while allowing new formats (OFX now, CSV/XLS later) to be added by introducing new parser implementations without changing endpoint orchestration.

## Consequences
- New file formats must be implemented as additional parser classes.
- The selector remains the single place that resolves which parser handles a file.
- The route only coordinates request validation, parser invocation, and execution of the application import command.
