- Topic: Validation workflow for `src` and `tests` changes

## Decision
When a task modifies files under `src` or `tests`, run `make verification` before starting and after completing the task.

## Rationale
This standardizes the full build/test pipeline for both frontend and backend whenever core code changes, reducing integration regressions.

## Consequences
Developers and agents must invoke `make verification` around any change that touches `src` or `tests`.
