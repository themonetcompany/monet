# Decision Record

- Topic: API read routes for balances and transactions

## Decision
Read endpoints in the Web API must delegate retrieval to application query handlers (`GetAccountBalancesQueryHandler`, `GetTransactionsQueryHandler`) backed by in-memory projections implementing provider ports.

## Rationale
This keeps the presenter layer thin, reuses application authorization behavior, and keeps read-side data access behind application ports.

## Consequences
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/balance` resolves the account from application-provided balances.
- `GET /api/transactions` returns application-provided transaction read models.
- Import writes and read queries share the same in-memory projected event flow through `ProjectingEventStore`.
