- Topic: Current date/time access

## Decision
When the code needs the current date/time, it must use the `IClock` interface to obtain that information.

## Rationale
Centralizing access to the current time improves testability and keeps time-related behavior consistent across the application.

## Consequences
Direct calls to `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` for current time should be avoided. Implementations should depend on `IClock` for the current timestamp.
