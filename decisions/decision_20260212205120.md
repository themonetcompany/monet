- Topic: Idempotent startup bootstrap for default categories

## Decision
The hardcoded default category catalog is injected at application startup by publishing `CategoryCreated` events only when the corresponding category aggregate does not already exist.

## Rationale
This provides deterministic defaults for development and first use while preserving Event Sourcing as the source of truth.

## Consequences
- Startup is idempotent and can run repeatedly without duplicating category events.
- New environments automatically receive a usable category catalog.
- Existing environments keep their previously created category aggregates unchanged.
