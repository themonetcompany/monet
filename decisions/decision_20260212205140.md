# Decision Record

- Date: 12-02-2026 20:51:40
- Topic: Transaction flow type location

## Decision
The transaction flow type (`Expense`, `Income`, `Neutral`) is modeled on transaction events/read models and not inside the `Amount` value object.

## Rationale
`Amount` is a generic monetary value reused outside transaction movement semantics (for example balances). Keeping flow type on transaction avoids coupling unrelated monetary concepts.

## Consequences
- `Amount` remains a reusable and neutral value object.
- Transaction-specific behavior is expressed on transaction models/events.
- Category assignment logic depends on transaction flow type, not on `Amount` internals.
