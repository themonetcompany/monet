- Topic: Account creation mapping during OFX import

## Decision
OFX parsing must map unique account numbers from imported transactions into `TransactionImport.Account` entries so the import flow creates required accounts before transaction publication.

## Rationale
The application import handler already creates accounts from `import.Accounts` and validates account existence before importing transactions. Mapping accounts at parse time prevents `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` for first-time imports.

## Consequences
- OFX imports now include account creation payloads automatically.
- Account names default to the account number when no explicit account label is available in OFX data.
- Import API response includes `importedAccounts` for visibility.
