- Topic: Aggregate account balances endpoint shape

## Decision
The API route for account balances returns the full collection of balances using `GET /api/accounts/balances`.

## Rationale
Balance retrieval is a read-model query over all accounts and should be exposed as a collection endpoint rather than a single-account path.

## Consequences
- Clients fetch all account balances in one call.
- Any single-account lookup can be done client-side from the returned collection.
