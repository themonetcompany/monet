- Topic: Access to authenticated user context

## Decision
When code needs information about the currently authenticated user (excluding personal data), it must go through the `IAuthenticationGateway` interface.

## Rationale
Centralizing access to authentication context keeps identity concerns consistent, testable, and decoupled from infrastructure.

## Consequences
Direct access to framework-specific authentication APIs should be avoided in application code. Instead, depend on `IAuthenticationGateway` for user context.
