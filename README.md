# Monet

Monet is a personal finance app that organizes money the way people live: not just by expense categories, but by the **Projects** and **Areas** that shape everyday life. It adds a second dimension to budgeting so you can track goals and responsibilities alongside traditional categories.

## Projects: temporary goals
A Project is a dedicated budget with a clear start, end, and objective—like a ski vacation, a kitchen renovation, or a wedding. Each Project shows its initial budget, spending to date, and remaining balance, and it moves to archives once complete.

## Areas: ongoing responsibilities
An Area represents a continuous part of your life with no end date—like personal finances, family life, a rental property, or health. Areas provide analysis suited to their nature, such as profitability for a rental property or spending trends for family life.

## How it works
Every transaction is categorized (food, housing, transportation, etc.) and can also be linked to one or more Projects or Areas. This gives you a clear view of how your money supports your goals and ongoing responsibilities.

## The result
With Monet, you instantly understand the state of your projects, the health of your areas, and the evolution of your overall budget—aligned with real life.
